abstract = {The Poisson binomial distribution is the distribution of the sum of independent and non-identically distributed random indicators. Each indicator follows a Bernoulli distribution and the individual probabilities of success vary. When all success probabilities are equal, the Poisson binomial distribution is a binomial distribution. The Poisson binomial distribution has many applications in different areas such as reliability, actuarial science, survey sampling, econometrics, etc. The computing of the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the Poisson binomial distribution, however, is not straightforward. Approximation methods such as the Poisson approximation and normal approximations have been used in literature. Recursive formulae also have been used to compute the cdf in some areas. In this paper, we present a simple derivation for an exact formula with a closed-form expression for the cdf of the Poisson binomial distribution. The derivation uses the discrete Fourier transform of the characteristic function of the distribution. We develop an algorithm that efficiently implements the exact formula. Numerical studies were conducted to study the accuracy of the developed algorithm and approximation methods. We also studied the computational efficiency of different methods. The paper is concluded with a discussion on the use of different methods in practice and some suggestions for practitioners.}

abstract="I introduce voting by proxy for constructing and operating legislatures, and then compare it to direct representation, plurality, and single transferable vote (STV), which voting by proxy most closely resembles. When each voter uses voting by proxy to select his proxy among given legislators and elections are costless, voting by proxy maximizes the legislature's representation of the voting population. When each voter uses preferential voting by proxy, selecting a proxy during the vote count as well as a proxy in the legislature, and some ancillary rules are followed, I find that voting by proxy dominates STV and offers favorable tradeoffs against plurality. It improves representation and constituent service; eliminates gerrymandering; improves voter turnout; ranks the legislature's representatives by the proxies they hold rather than seniority; creates tighter representative-constituent links that lead to better informed voters, reducing the influence of special interests; and eliminates primary and runoff elections. Extra costs associated with its relative complexity or better representation can be made small.",

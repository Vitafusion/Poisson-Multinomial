1. Waiting to finish the R package part since the benchmark result is not coming up.
2. ref.bib is not implemented.


Some places that could be improved.

1. TAE test of DFT-CF method needs large n (n>2000), the plot is not enough to show a stable TAE.

2. Need to state that SIM method could be working when m is moderate and n is small.
	2.1 could use SIM to compute mass points out of users' interests.
	2.2 for moderate m and small n, DFT-CF actually works badly.
	2.3 Let n be around 5, m = 10,15,20 maybe, using multinomial distribution and selected points, it could be testable.

3. could add time efficiency study of SIM.

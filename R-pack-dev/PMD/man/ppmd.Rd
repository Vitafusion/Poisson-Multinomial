\title{Cumulative Distribution Function of Poisson-Multinomial Distribution}
\usage{
ppmd(pmat, xmat, method = "DFT-CF", B = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{pmat}{An \eqn{\rm n \times m} matrix of probabilities. \eqn{\rm n} is the number of independent trials.
\eqn{\rm m} is the number of categories.
Each row of pmat describes the success probability for the corresponding
trial and it should add up to 1.}

\item{xmat}{A matrix with column number \eqn{\rm m} and each row has the form \eqn{\rm x = (x_{1},\ldots,x_{m})} for computing 
\eqn{\rm P(X_{1} \leq x_{1},\ldots, X_{m} \leq x_{m})}.}

\item{method}{Character string stands for the method selected by user to 
compute the probability mass. The method can only be one of 
the following three: 
\code{"DFT-CF"},
\code{"NA"},
\code{"SIM"}.}

\item{B}{Number of repetitions in the simulation method. Will be ignored if users do not
choose \code{"SIM"} method.}
}
\value{
The value of \eqn{\rm P(X_{1} \leq x_{1},\ldots, X_{m} \leq x_{m})} of given 
\eqn{\rm x = (x_{1},\ldots, x_{m})}.
}
\description{
This function computes cumulative distribution function of 
Poisson-Multinomial distributions that specified by input probability matrix 
via given method.
}
\details{
See Details in \code{dpmd} for the definition of the PMD and the introduction of notations.
\code{ppmd} computes the cumulative distribution function by adding all probability 
mass points within hyper-dimensional space limited by \code{x}. 

\code{"DFT-CF"} is an exact method 
to calculate all mass points of Poisson-Multinomial Distributions
via FFT algorithm.
\code{"SIM"} is a simulation method using a naive simulation scheme to 
calculate the whole probability mass function.
\code{"NA"} is an approximation method using Normal approximation method.

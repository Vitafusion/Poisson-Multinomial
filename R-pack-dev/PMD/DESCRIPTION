Description: Applying exact, simulation and approximation methods for computing probability mass functions, cumulative distribution functions of Poisson-Multinomial distributions together with a random number generator to conduct Poisson-Multinomial distribution sampling. The exact method is based on fast Fourier transformation of the characteristic functions of Poisson-Multinomial distributions. Simulation method is built via naive sampling scheme of different multinomial distributions. Approximation method is designed by asymptotic distrbutions of Poisson-Multinomial distributions, which are normal.
